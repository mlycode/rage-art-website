                    <p>A series of colour studies created through diluted acrylic paint onto wood. The technique is similar to marbling, whereas I apply the acrylic onto the wood surface and let it dry for a completely random result. Personally, I quite enjoy this process as Iâ€™m usually a perfectionist and allowing myself to accept a finishing product without careful input is exciting.</p>
